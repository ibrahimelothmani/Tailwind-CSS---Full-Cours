    5. Directives:

    are custom Tailwind-specific at-rules you can use in your CSS 
    that offer special functionality for Tailwind CSS projects.
    => Use the @tailwind directive to insert Tailwind’s base, 
    components, utilities and variants styles into your CSS.

    5.1. @layer :
    
    Use the @layer directive to tell Tailwind which “bucket” a set of custom styles belong to.
    Valid layers are base, components, and utilities.

    => the problem is there is so many css class in your html files
    so we put classes in the input.css by using @layer

    EXAMPLE:

    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;

   /*  
   @layer base {
  h1 {
    font-size: 2rem;
  }
  h2 {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
  }
}
*/

OR => the best way is to use  @apply :
Use @apply to inline any existing utility classes into your own custom CSS.
This is useful when you need to write custom CSS (like to override the styles in a third-party library) 
but still want to work with your design tokens and use the same syntax you’re used to using in your HTML.

@layer base {
  h1 {
    @apply text-2xl; => for all the h1 tag.
  }
  h2 {
    @apply text-xl; => for all the h2 tag.
  }
}

@layer components {
  .btn-blue {
    @apply bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded;
  }
}

@layer utilities {
  .filter-none {
    filter: none;
  }
  .filter-grayscale {
    filter: grayscale(100%);
  }
}

=> this add will be showing automaticly in the style.css file

5.2. The theme :

in the config file (tailwind.config.js) :

theme:{
  extend: {
    spacing: {
      128: '32rem',
      // we can put what ever we want , the spacing here is just an example
    },
  },
},

so in the html file we add a text in the <p> tag and we give him a class
  then in the input.css file we manchen this class and we give him the "spacing in the theme"
  by using 
  @apply bg-green-200;
  height: theme('spacing.128'); // example


6. the media query:

we can put in the input.css file the min and the max width by using this:

@media screen(xsm,sm,md,lg,xl,2xl){
  body{
    @apply bg-black text-white; => just an example
  }
}
