    1 - first (THE CDN):
    if you have a small project Or if you want to develop or testing
    you can use the CDN by including the cdn script in the top of the code after the meta tag

    2. second (using PostCSS):
    the PostCSS is used when you have a build tools like 
    webpack, Rolup, Vite and Parcel

    3. third (TailwindCLI):
    The simplest and fastest way to get up and running with Tailwind CSS from scratch is with the Tailwind CLI tool.
    The CLI is also available as a standalone executable if you want to use it without installing Node.js.

    So For our Project we gonna use TailwindCLI:

    1. in the terminal in our code editor:

    npm init -y => create package.json
    npm install -D tailwindcss or npm i -D tailwindcss => install a folder node_modules
    npx tailwindcss init => create a config file (tailwindcss.config.js)

    2. In the tailwind.config.js :

    /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */

    module.exports = {
        content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"], => here we just put content: ['./*.html'],
        theme: {
            extend: {},
        },
        plugins: [],
    }

    3. Create a file Named input.css

    put in the file this codes:

    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;

    4. install the Extension : PostCSS Language Support

    5. tap this command in the terminal:

    npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch

    thats mean everytime I will run this command ?
    
    => instand of this we can juste do this configuration

    Solution :

    In the package.json :

    "script" : {
        "build": "tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./css/style.css"
        "watch": "tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./css/style.css --watch"
    }

    6. In the terminal we put :

    npm run build => It will create a folder named css/style.css
    
    7. Include this file in our index.html:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">

    8. In the terminal we put :

    npm run watch => to WATCH this file

    9. Go Live => Live Server

    10. You Can Start building your project

    11. If you want to stop your terminal use the commant => CTRL + C

    12. but everytime you should put in the terminal => npm run watch => to watch your project
